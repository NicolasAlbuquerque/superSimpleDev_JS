COMPARISON OPERATOR

> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
=== equal to
!== not equal to 


theres two ways in JS to check if twp values are equals
== or ===

the diference is :

==
DOUBLE EQUALS
-try to convert both values into the same type, for exemple
console.log(5=='5.00'); the result wil be true because double equals make a conversion 


===
Triple EQUALS
to evoid the value conversion 



the same for the not equal to

always use !== with two equals to avoid the conversion behavior
