MATH

OPERATORS
- MINUS
 
 2 - 2 = 0


+ PLUS

  2 + 2 = 4
 
* STAR -- MULTIPLY

2 * 5 = 10  <-- called times too ex:  two times five.

/ FORWARD SLASH -- DIVIDE

10 / 2 = 5

ORDER OF OPERATIONS

* / ARE DONE FIRS (have the same priority)
+ - ARE DONE AFTER (have the same priority)

THE ORDER OF OPERATION ARE ALSO CALLED:
Operator precedence

('Brackets') - have the higher priority of OPERATIONS

MORE DETAILS ABOUTH MATH IN JavaScript

in programin: 
2, 3, 4 =  INTEGERS "hole numbers"

2.2 , 2.5 = FLOATING POINT NUMBERS (FLOATS)
floating



 

- weird behavior of math in JavaScript

(
    CALCULATIONS WITH FLOATS ARE SOMETIMES INACCURATE


    2.95+7.99 = 28.93999999
    
    
    how do we avoid this problem with float numbers ???
    
   
BEST PRATICE WHEN CALCULARING MONEY 

= CALCULATE IN CENTS INSTEAD OF DOLLARS
AND CONVERT BACK TO DOLLARS 
2095 + 799 = 2894 / 100 = 28.94)

HOW TO ROUND A NUMBERS

rounding means taking a
number and moving it to the nearest integer  

Math.round(2.2) the result will be 2
Math.round(2.8)
the result will be 3
